## Pods Overview

Each pod owns a slice of the 30-app portfolio. Work inside these pod notes so agents can operate independently and keep handoffs clean. Every pod doc follows the same format:

1. **Owners / Agents** – Assign a name or initials so it’s clear who is driving.
2. **Scope** – List the slugs + directories owned by the pod.
3. **Immediate Queue** – Checklist of tasks following the RUNBOOK (scaffold → SPEC/UX → logic → UI → README/apple → QA).
4. **Status Log** – Timestamped checkpoints so reviews happen at the right time.

When a pod finishes a stage (e.g., SPEC ready for review), ping the Studio Director and note it in the Status Log. Always reference the RUNBOOK for workflow details and keep shared patterns in sync.
