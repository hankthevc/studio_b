# LayoverLoop SPEC

## Problem
Builds 2–4 hour layover playbooks with lounge picks, quick detours, and transit timing so airport downtime feels intentional.

## Target user
Travel/loyalty apps that need a turnkey layover concierge.

## User stories
- As a user, I want to pick a layover city, length, vibe, and transit comfort.
- As a user, I want to layoverloop sketches arrival reset, city loop, and return glide cards.
- As a user, I want to copy/share the plan or regenerate until the vibe hits.

## MVP checklist
- [ ] Deterministic logic hooked into shared plan builder
- [ ] Shared app shell layout + branded tokens
- [ ] README, EMBED, UX notes, and apple metadata updated
